      <p>Welcome to lesson 2. The previous lesson was about getting set up for HTML. Now, we're going to start actually doing it.</p>
      <p>We talked about tags in the last lesson. I also showed you the tags that you use to start a program: < html > < /html>.</p>
      <p>Start by typing those tags. Put the end tag below the starting tag, so the code can go down instead of across the screen</p>
      <p>Once you've done that, we can start with some simple code. First, there are tags that choose the size of heading. Those are</p>
      <p>< h1 >, < h2 >, < h3 >, < h4 >, < h5 >, and < h6 >. Remember, for every opening tag there has to be a closing tag. To make</p>
      <p>a closing tag, just repeat the open tag but add a backslash to it, like this: < /h1>. Between those two tags, you can write</p>
      <p>anything you want. Once your done with that, save the code as lesson2.html. That html at the end is very important. It</p>
      <p>lets the computer know that file is an html file. After you've saved the file, open it, and the words you wrote will appear</p>
      <p>in big font on the upper-left hand portion of the screen. You've made your first program! We'll learn how to move the words</p>
      <p>and change the color and stuff in the CSS part of the course. For now, save your code in a lessons folder, and move to lesson</p>
      <p>3!</p>
