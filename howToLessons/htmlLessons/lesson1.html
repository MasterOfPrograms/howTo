      <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's the language that is used for websites. To write HTML, you need a text editer, like notepad, or I use atom.</p>
      <p>You can download atom for free at atom.io. When you have a text editer, go to your files and make a new folder called projects. This is were you'll be storing</p>
      <P>your code. If you want to create more folders to organize more, do so. When your done with that, open your text editer. You'll get a blank space. That's were</p>
      <p>you'll write your code.</p>

      <p>Everything in HTML is writen in tags. Tags go in pairs, an opening tag and a closing tag. The tag you use to start a program is this: < html > < /html >.</p>
      <p>You'll notice that one tag dosn't have a backslash, and one does. The backslash is how you tell the computer that you are ending your tag set. Everything</p>
      <p>in your program, all the rest of your tags, will go between those tags.</p>
